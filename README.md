# rails_shooter

In this project, I followed along with a Udemy course on Unity3D game development and created the 
prototype for an on-the-rails space shooter.


I learned about:

• Unity Timeline feature to move the ship and enemies

• How to use particle systems as projectiles

• Instantiating enemies at runtime

• Enemy and Player health/damage systems

• How to control the rotation of the player ship by manipulating the yaw, pitch and roll values

• Many other game design and C# programming concepts
